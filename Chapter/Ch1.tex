\section{Introduction}

This generic template demonstrates the structure for a research proposal or technical report. It includes examples of lists, citations, mathematics, figures, and side-by-side tables.

\subsection{Problem Statement}
The management of complex systems often relies on classification. However, distinct challenges remain:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Heterogeneity:} Data points often exhibit different trajectories \citep{smith2023analysis}.
    \item \textbf{Scale:} Large-scale datasets ranging from millions to billions of records pose computational challenges.
    \item \textbf{Spatial Patterns:} Regional disparities remain underexplored.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Existing Approaches}
Various methods exist in the literature, though each has limitations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Method A:} Effective for small data but scales poorly.
    \item \textit{Method B:} Computationally efficient but loses temporal information \citep{williams2022guide}.
    \item \textit{Method C:} Handles mixed-types but requires heavy GPU usage.
\end{itemize}
